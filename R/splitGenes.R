#' @title Split Genes By Chromosome (Arm)
#' @description Split Genes By Chromosome (Arm). Input can be one of a matrix to be split into several matrices or a character vector of gene names to be split into several character vectors.
#' @param x a matrix with gene names as rows or a character vector of gene names.
#' @param by a string; one of 'chr' or 'arm', determining how the matrix or character vector should be split. Default: 'chr'
#' @return if a matrix was provided, a list of matrices. If a character vector was provided, a list of character vectors. Both lists will be of length # of chromosome (arms) in the genome in question. Ie. length 24 for H.sapiens.
