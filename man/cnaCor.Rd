\title{Cell - Tumour CNA Correlations}
\usage{
cnaCor(
  cna,
  cor.method = "pearson",
  cell.quantile = NULL,
  gene.quantile.for.cells = NULL,
  gene.quantile = NULL,
  cell.quantile.for.genes = NULL,
  refCells = NULL,
  samples = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cna}{a matrix of gene rows by cell columns containing CNA values.}

\item{cor.method}{character string indicating the method to use for the pairwise correlations. E.g. 'pearson', 'spearman'. Default: 'pearson'}

\item{gene.quantile}{calculate CNA measures including only top / "hotspot" genes according to their squared CNA values across all cells. Value between 0 and 1 denoting the quantile of genes to include. Default: NULL}

\item{refCells}{a character vector of cell ids to exclude from average CNA profile that each cell is correlated to. You can pass reference normal cell ids to this argument if these are known. Default: NULL}

\item{samples}{if CNA correlations should be calculated within cell subgroups, provide i) a list of cell id groups, ii) a character vector of sample names to group cells by, iii) TRUE to extract sample names from cell ids and subsequently group. Default: NULL}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to unique_sample_names if samples = TRUE.}
}
\value{
a numeric vector or list of numeric vectors
}
\description{
Compute the pairwise correlations between individual cells' CNA values and the average CNA values in their tumour of origin.
