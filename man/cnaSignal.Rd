\usage{
cnaSignal(
  cna,
  gene.quantile = NULL,
  cell.quantile.for.genes = NULL,
  refCells = NULL,
  samples = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cna}{a matrix of gene rows by cell columns containing CNA values.}

\item{gene.quantile}{calculate CNA measures including only top / "hotspot" genes according to their squared CNA values across all cells. Value between 0 and 1 denoting the quantile of genes to include. Default: NULL}

\item{refCells}{a character vector of cell ids (e.g. normal reference cell ids) to exclude from calculation of cnaHotspotGenes. Only relevant if gene.quantile is not NULL. Default: NULL}

\item{samples}{if cnaHotspotGenes should be calculated within cell subgroups, provide i) a list of cell id groups, ii) a character vector of sample names to group cells by, iii) TRUE to extract sample names from cell ids and subsequently group. Default: NULL}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to unique_sample_names if samples = TRUE.}
}
\value{
a numeric vector of CNA signal values or the Mean of Squared CNA values
}
