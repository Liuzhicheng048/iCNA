\title{Filter Genes by their Genome Features}
\usage{
filterGenes(x, value, attribute, out = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character vector of gene names or a matrix with gene row names.}

\item{value}{a value or a list of values that are the genome features to filter}

\item{attribute}{the name(s) of the genome feature(s) in question. One of 'chr', 'arm'.}

\item{out}{boolean value indicating whether the filtered genes should be thrown rather than kept. Default: F}
}
\value{
filtered vector or a matrix with filtered rows, depending on class of <x>.
}
\description{
Filter genes to keep (the default) or to out according to genomic features. For example, filter genes that are either on chromosome 7 or chromosome arm 2p.
