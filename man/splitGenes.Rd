\title{Split Genes By Chromosome (Arm)}
\usage{
splitGenes(x, by = "chr")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix with gene names as rows or a character vector of gene names.}

\item{by}{a string; one of 'chr' or 'arm', determining how the matrix or character vector should be split. Default: 'chr'}
}
\value{
if a matrix was provided, a list of matrices. If a character vector was provided, a list of character vectors. Both lists will be of length # of chromosome (arms) in the genome in question. Ie. length 24 for H.sapiens.
}
\description{
Split Genes By Chromosome (Arm). Input can be one of a matrix to be split into several matrices or a character vector of gene names to be split into several character vectors.
