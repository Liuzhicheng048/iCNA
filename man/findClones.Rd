\arguments{
\item{m}{a matrix of genes X cells (variables X observations) containing CNA values.}

\item{prob}{a numeric value >= 0 and <= 1; the minimum posterior probability required for an observation to be assigned to a mode. Default: 0.95}

\item{coverage}{the fraction of observations that must have a posterior probability higher than <prob> to one of two modes in order for the distribution to qualify as bimodal. Default: 0.8}

\item{mode.size}{the minimum number of observations required to define a mode. Default: 10}

\item{clone.size}{the minimum number of cells required to define a clone. Default: 3}

\item{by}{PARAM_DESCRIPTION, Default: 'chr'}

\description{
Assign cells to genetic subclones from their inferred CNA profiles. You can compute their CNA profiles using infercna::infercna().
